Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.

Need to make some chages to make the code work as desired, when player 'O' and 'X' play(move), whatever they play in their next moves must not be the same ones they moved earlier.

And also declare a winner when there is a diagonal 'correspondence'.
